          <h2>The Correlation Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>

          <h4>Obesity & Poverty</h4>
          <p>There appears to be a slight correlation obesity & poverty according to the data. In states where there is a higher rate of poverity, the population tends to have a higher rate of obesity, although the correlation is not very strong.</p>

          <h4>Smoking & Poverty</h4>
          <p>Again, not a strong correlation between smoking individuals and poverty, although there is a slight indication in the data that in states where there is a higher rate of poverty, there tends to be a higher rate of those who smoke.</p>

          <h4>Lacks Healthcare & Poverty</h4>
          <p>It may not come as a surprise that there is a correlation between the rate of poverty and lacking healthcare coverage. There is a positive correlation in the data showing that the higher rate of poverty, typically lends to a higher rate of those lacking healthcare coverage.</p>

          <h4>Obesity & Age</h4>
          <p>There is no strong correlation here, other than a slight correlation between obesity & older age, likely due to the fact that those higher in age are likely less active than younger adults.</p>

          <h4>Smoking & Age</h4>
          <p>There is a strong positive correlation between higher median age and smokers, likely due to the fact that smoking was far more popular and widely accepted for older generations.</p>

          <h4>Lacks Healthcare & Age</h4>
          <p>The data shows that with higher median age in states, the lower the rate of those who lack healthcare coverage. This is likely explained by adults having more stability in their careers and benefits that are provided through their employer.</p>

          <h4>Obesity & Household Income</h4>
          <p>It appears that there is a negative correlation here, suggesting that obesity is less prevalent for those with a higher household income. This could be due to a variety of factors, but may include the ability to afford healthier food regularly, gym memberships, etc.</p>

          <h4>Smoking & Household Income</h4>
          <p>Not a surprise due to a slight positive correlation between Smoking & Poverty, there is a negative correlation between smoking and household income. The higher the household income, the lesser the rate of smoking individuals.</p>

          <h4>Lacks Healthcare & Household Income</h4>
          <p>Again, similar to the above scenario where we saw a positive correlation between lacking healthcare coverage for those in poverty, we see a negative correlation in the data for those with a higher household income, not lacking healthcare coverage.</p>
